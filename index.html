    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>and we were totally out of wine...</p>
    <p>which didn't bode well for the Netflix and chill</p>
    <p>so we pull up a blanket and snuggle up tight, turning off the TV; rain falling softly on the windows and lulling us to sleep...</p>
    <p>one two...Freddy's coming for you...</p>
    <p>three four...Heather was at the door.</p>
